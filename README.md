Ray Tracing Sphere Visualizer

This project is a simple ray tracing application that allows users to visualize and manipulate spheres in a 3D space. It's built using JavaFX for the user interface and implements basic ray tracing algorithms for rendering.
Features

Render up to three spheres in a 3D space
Adjust the position (X, Y, Z coordinates) of each sphere individually
Modify the color (RGB values) of all spheres simultaneously
Real-time updates as you adjust sphere properties
Simple diffuse shading for better depth perception

Usage

Use the radio buttons to select which sphere you want to manipulate.
Adjust the X, Y, and Z sliders to change the position of the selected sphere.
Use the Red, Green, and Blue sliders to modify the color of all spheres.
The render updates in real-time as you make changes.

Implementation Details

The application uses a basic ray tracing algorithm to render the spheres.
Diffuse shading is implemented for better visual quality.
The GUI is built using JavaFX, providing an interactive way to manipulate the scene.
